    //
    // **The thing this must never do is lose settings.json.** Silently erasing
    // settings is the worst bug this app has shipped, and a migration is the
    // easiest place to ship it again: a move that half-completes, a second
    // process racing the first, a crash between two copies. So the shape is
    // chosen around that one file:
    //
    //   - A move where a move is possible. Directory.Move on one volume is a
    //     rename — all or nothing — and it is the only option that does not
    //     double ~130 MB of speech engine and every cloned .app bundle on disk.
    //   - A copy only when the move refuses (another volume, a file held open),
    //     and then settings.json is copied **last**, so its presence in the new
    //     folder is the commit record. A crash mid-copy leaves "new folder, no
    //     settings.json", which the next launch recognises and resumes; it can
    //     never leave a new settings.json beside a half-copied rest. Each file
    //     goes to a ".partial" name first and is renamed into place, so a crash
    //     mid-file cannot leave a torn file that the resume then skips as
    //     already present.
    //   - New wins whenever the new folder already has settings.json. That is
    //     both "a dev build ran before the upgrade" and "the second launch after
    //     a successful move", and the rule does not need to tell them apart.
    //   - After a move, the legacy folder is recreated holding copies of
    //     settings.json and peer-identity.json plus a note, so a downgraded
    //     build still finds its settings and its TLS identity (pairing
    //     survives). The legacy folder is never deleted on the copy path —
    //     it is left whole.
    //
    // It runs from Startup.Run's `migrateUserData` step: after both mutex names
    // are held (so no second instance, old or new, can be moving the same
    // folder) and before anything reads OrbweaverSettings, PeerIdentity or
    // NeuralSpeech. Checked rather than assumed for the two steps that run
    // before it: neither CrashLog.cs nor SingleInstance.cs refers to
    // OrbweaverSettings at all. CrashLog.Install does not create its
    // directory either — only a write does — but a crash or a persona refusal
    // could have created the new Logs folder before now, which is why the Logs
    // rule below is a merge rather than move-or-nothing.
    //
    // Does nothing at all while ORBWEAVER_SETTINGS_DIR, ORBWEAVER_LOG_DIR
    // or ORBWEAVER_BUNDLE_ROOT is set. Every test suite sets the first, and
