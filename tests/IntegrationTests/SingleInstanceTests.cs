// SingleInstance.Claim against a real named mutex — the seam
// tests/UnitTests' SingleInstanceTests cannot reach, because that suite only
// asserts the pure ShouldProceed rule against a SingleInstanceClaim someone
// already computed. This is the "someone" — a real OS-backed named
// synchronization object, exactly like the one Program.cs takes on
// MutexName, and it is the reason Claim takes the name as a parameter rather
// than reading MutexName itself: a per-test, GUID-suffixed name here means
// this suite can never collide with a real running Buddy on this machine, nor
// with a parallel CI leg exercising the same code (CB-178).
//
// The first four run in-process. The CB-206 cases at the bottom do not: the
// defect there was that the mutex was scoped to one POSIX session, so a Buddy
// launched from another session never saw it, and only a second process in a
// session of its own can show that. tests/SingleInstanceProbe is that second
// process; it compiles SingleInstance.cs in and makes one claim.
//
// Not covered here: SingleInstanceClaim.AbandonedByPreviousOwner. That arm
// only fires when `WaitOne` throws `AbandonedMutexException`, and
// SingleInstance.cs's own comment records the actual measurement: on this
// machine (macOS, .NET 10.0.400) that exception was never thrown, for
// either way a holder can go away without releasing — killed outright, or
// exited normally past the point where it should have called
// ReleaseMutex. `Release_lets_a_later_claimant_succeed` and
// `Recovers_after_the_previous_holder_never_released_it` below exercise
// exactly those two shapes and both land on Acquired, which is the real,
// measured crash-recovery path on this platform. Reproducing the
// AbandonedMutexException arm itself would mean asserting behaviour this
// runtime does not exhibit; the CB-178 PR body has the harness (a second
// real process, `kill -9`'d) and its output instead.
