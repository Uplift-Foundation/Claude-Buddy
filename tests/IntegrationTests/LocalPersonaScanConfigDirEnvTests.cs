// CB-143's regression test, driving the mechanism on purpose rather than
// waiting for a CI runner to interleave into it.
//
// The flake: LocalPersonaScanTests.AnImportedFileSettlesRatherThanResolvingEveryPass
// failed once on windows-latest and passed twice on the identical sha. The two
// personas had identical content and differed only in object identity, so
// nothing about resolution went wrong — what broke was the scan's settling
// invariant. ApplyPersona asked LocalPersona.UserConfigDirs on every pass,
// which reads CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR; UsagePollerEnvironmentTests holds that
// variable at a sentinel while its stand-in child process runs, and it is in a
// *different* xUnit collection, which is to say it runs in parallel. One extra
// candidate path — a config directory that does not even exist — is one extra
// record in the signature, and a signature that differs is the scan's
// definition of "something moved".
//
// Separate from LocalPersonaScanTests, and [Collection("ConfigDirEnv")], for
// the reason ConfigDirEnvCollection.cs gives from the other direction: a class
// that sets CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR while AgentRosterEnvironmentTests is between its
// read and its launch would cause exactly the flake that collection exists to
// prevent. Writing the regression test into the Settings collection would have
// fixed one flake by introducing another.
//
// Both cases below pin the provider — which is the fix — so neither is really
// about the environment any more. That is the point: the positive case is the
// one that used to fail, and the negative control beside it is what says the
// fixture is capable of failing at all.
