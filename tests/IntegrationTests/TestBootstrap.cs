// %APPDATA%/Orbweaver (Windows) or ~/Library/Application Support/Orbweaver
// (macOS) — settings.json does not follow HOME on macOS, so without this an
// integration test run would read and could overwrite the developer's own
// settings.
//
// One directory for the whole assembly, not one per test. Most tests here
// never touch OrbweaverSettings at all (hook-script and TranscriptReader
// tests are pure file/process tests), and the ones that do are the P1
// SettingsRoundTripTests, which are collected under [Collection("Settings")]
// and repoint this env var themselves before calling ReloadForTests() — see
// that class for why sharing the static model safely needs both.

        // collector puts its IPC socket under it. The collector's server end
        // had already computed that path from the *original* TMPDIR before this
        // assembly was loaded; the client end, running after this initializer,
        // computed a different one — so `tools/coverage.sh` never got a
        // cobertura report out of either MTP suite, and the whole 100%-of-added-
        // lines rule in CLAUDE.md was unenforceable while that was true.
        //
        // It surfaced as two unrelated-looking errors, which is why it took
        // three attempts to pin down. MTP runs this executable twice (a test
        // host controller and the test host under it), so the initializer fired
        // twice and nested a second cbt- directory inside the first: on macOS
        // that put the socket path at 117 bytes against a 104-byte sun_path cap
        // and threw ArgumentOutOfRangeException. Shorten TMPDIR and the length
        // check passes, the client still looks in the wrong place, and you get
        // a TimeoutException instead. One cause, two faces.
