// The scan's half of the persona feature, driven against a real filesystem.
//
// LocalPersonaFilesTests covers what the reader refuses; the unit suites cover
// the grammar and the fold. What none of them can answer is the question this
// one is about: does the thing that runs twice a second actually put a persona
// in the registry, does it stop reading the disk once it has, and does it
// notice when somebody edits the file — including a file that is only reached
// through an `@` import, which is not a candidate and so is invisible to the
// candidate list alone.
//
// SessionManager.ApplyPersona rather than ScanAndUpdate, deliberately.
// ScanAndUpdate builds OrbWindows and needs an Avalonia application, which is
// why SessionScanTests lives in tests/UiTests — and there is an end-to-end
// scan-to-registry case there for exactly that reason. Everything ApplyPersona
// does is filesystem, so it belongs here, where the filesystem is real and no
// window has to exist for it to run.
//
// The user-level config directories are PINNED, and that is CB-143's change.
//
// ApplyPersona used to ask LocalPersona.UserConfigDirs on every pass, which
// reads two pieces of process-wide mutable state: the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
// environment variable and ClaudeCodeProfileDirs by way of ClaudeConfigRoots.
// Either one changing between two passes lengthens the candidate list, which
// changes the signature, which is the scan's definition of "something moved" —
// so the persona resolved again and the registry got a brand-new object with
// identical content. Every case below whose claim is "the same object came
// back" then fails with nothing wrong with it and nothing in its own fixture to
// point at.
//
// That is not hypothetical and it is not only a settings problem.
// AnImportedFileSettlesRatherThanResolvingEveryPass failed once on the Windows
// CI leg and passed twice on the identical sha, and the mechanism was the
// environment variable: UsagePollerEnvironmentTests and
// AgentRosterEnvironmentTests are [Collection("ConfigDirEnv")], a *different*
// collection, which xUnit runs in parallel with this one, and the first of
// those holds CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR at a sentinel while a stand-in child process
// runs. One extra record in the signature — a config directory that does not
// even exist — is the whole of it.
//
// The two writers were reachable by two different collection attributes, and a
// third attribute would only have closed one of them. Pinning the provider
// closes both at once and closes them structurally: this scan no longer reads
// either global, so there is nothing left for a future writer of either to
// disturb. Array.Empty rather than the machine's real answer for a second
// reason — without it these cases read the developer's own ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md,
// so a persona written there would break AProjectWithNoPersonaIsRecordedAsHavingNone
// on that machine and nowhere else. The user-level arm is covered on purpose
// below, against a fixture directory, instead of by accident against a real one.
//
// [Collection("Settings")] is kept as a second line rather than as the
// mechanism: the seam is what makes the claims independent, and the attribute
// only still costs nothing.
//
// LocalPersonas is process-wide too, so every case uses its own session id and
// empties the registry afterwards.
