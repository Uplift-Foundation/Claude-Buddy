    // Two things that turn text nobody controls into things the panel shows,
    // and both fail quietly when they fail.
    //
    // The transcript mapper decides what a conversation *was*, and its failure
    // mode is a message silently missing - a row type it didn't recognise, a
    // filter that caught too much. Nothing on screen says so.
    //
    // The dialog parser is worse. Its output becomes buttons that send
    // keystrokes into a live session, so a mis-parse doesn't show a wrong label,
    // it *presses the wrong thing*. Most of the cases below are attempts to make
    // it do that.
    //
    // **Why the cases live here rather than in Program.cs.**
    // tests/TranscriptTests is a plain console exe with no test SDK reference,
    // so tools/coverage.sh never counted a line of what it verifies:
    // ChatTranscript.cs read 0.5% and CodexTranscript.cs 30% while both were
    // being checked here in detail. tests/UnitTests compiles this file in and
    // runs the identical cases, which puts those lines in the denominator.
    // `dotnet run --project tests/TranscriptTests` still prints the same report,
    // and still takes a file to parse by hand - that half stayed in Program.cs.
    //
    // Every fixture below was confirmed against live output before being written
    // down, which is the only reason they match real output rather than
    // plausible output. The first version of the dialog parser was written
    // against an invented fixture and got the shape wrong three ways.
