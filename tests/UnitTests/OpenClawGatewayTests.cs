// What is worth pinning here is not "does a WebSocket work" — the BCL's does —
// but the handshake and the correlation, both of which fail in ways that are
// almost impossible to diagnose from the other end. The gateway answers a
// mis-signed payload with "unauthorized", a frame it did not expect with
// nothing, and a rejected connect by closing with the reason in the close frame
// rather than in the response. Each of those is a case below.
//
// Nothing here opens a socket. OpenClawGateway takes its connector as a
// constructor argument for exactly this reason — see its comment.
