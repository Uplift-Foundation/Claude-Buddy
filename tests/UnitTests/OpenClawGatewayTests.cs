// but the handshake and the correlation, both of which fail in ways that are
// almost impossible to diagnose from the other end. The gateway answers a

// nothing, and a rejected connect by closing with the reason in the close frame
// rather than in the response. Each of those is a case below.

            // this class failed intermittently four times in one session that

            // A busy machine does not, but a starved *thread pool* does. Under

            // every worker parked — the handshake over this very fake took
            // **25.5 seconds** on an idle-CPU Mac, against a thirty-second wall.
            // So thirty is not a wall a hang has to climb; it is four seconds of
            // headroom over a scheduling delay that is already measurable, and a
            // failure at thirty tells you nothing that a failure at two did not.
            // (That measurement is of a deliberately pathological pool, not of
            // a CI runner — it bounds what scheduling *can* cost, not what CI
