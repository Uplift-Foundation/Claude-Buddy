// The three rules that decide whether a status file becomes an orb:
// SessionManager.JudgeLiveness, WantsAgentViewer and JudgeReachability.
//
// These are the most-corrected lines in the app and every case below is a bug
// somebody shipped, not a shape invented to walk a branch. The comments in
// SessionManager name them: a Ctrl+C'd session whose orb never went away, an
// orb per subagent that accumulated forever on the "keep orbs forever"
// setting, a Codex file that no rule on any path could remove, a background
// agent that vanished the moment the hook learned to record its own pid. A
// wrong answer here is either an orb that is a dead click or a live session
// with nothing on screen, and neither announces itself.
//
// isRunning and transcriptExists are the two seams: the real ones are a
// kill(2) against a pid this machine may not have and a stat(2) against its
// disk. Passing them in is what makes the rules answerable without either —
// the same reasoning Superseded's own comment records. The daemon's answer
// arrives as a JobPhase value rather than a seam: the scan decides it once
// per pass and hands it in.
