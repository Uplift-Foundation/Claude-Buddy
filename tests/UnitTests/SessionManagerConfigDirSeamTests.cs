// The persona scan's config-directory seam, both arms of it (CB-143).
//
// ApplyPersona used to call LocalPersona.UserConfigDirs directly, which reads
// the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR environment variable and ClaudeCodeProfileDirs — two
// process-wide globals — on every pass. The answer is part of the candidate
// list and the candidate list is part of the signature, so anything that
// changed either between two passes made the scan resolve again and hand the
// registry a persona that was new by identity and identical by content. That
// is a settling failure rather than a resolution failure, and it is what made
// LocalPersonaScanTests.AnImportedFileSettlesRatherThanResolvingEveryPass fail
// once on the Windows CI leg and pass twice on the identical sha.
//
// The decision this covers is small and is exactly the one worth a unit test:
// with no provider given the scan asks the machine, and with one given the
// machine is not asked at all. The filesystem cases are in tests/IntegrationTests
// and the cost the seam protects — a portrait re-decoded per tick — is in
// tests/UiTests, since neither can be seen from here.
//
// No file has to exist for any of this. CandidateFiles is path arithmetic and
// nothing below reads the disk, so the fixture's working directory is a name
// rather than a directory.
//
// [Collection("Settings")] because the default arm reaches ClaudeConfigRoots,
// which reads ClaudeCodeProfileDirs.
