//
// The fixture is a real record, captured from the machine the duplicate "Mc"
// orbs were photographed on (CLI 2.1.251), with the user's paths and the
// session's title scrubbed and nothing else changed. It is the record of the
// *parent* — an interactive session, idle in a tmux pane, whose conversation
// had just been forked into a background job by opening agents mode. Nothing
// about it looks wrong: `kind` is still "interactive", `status` is still
// "idle", and the transcript it points at ends with a normally completed turn.
// The single field that says what happened is `parkedJobId`, which is the whole
// reason this rule reads the record rather than the transcript.
