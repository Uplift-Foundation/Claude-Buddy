    // and this test are running the identical cases against the identical rules.
    // What is new is that the lines now count. That project is a plain console
    // exe with no test SDK reference, so tools/coverage.sh never saw it, and the
    // most exhaustively verified file in the repository reported 0.0% — a number
    // CLAUDE.md warns about precisely because it reads like a gap and is not
    // one.

    // Kept as one Fact rather than a Theory per case. A hundred thousand xUnit
    // test cases would cost more in discovery and reporting than the sweep costs
    // to run, and the sweep's own grouped report is a better failure message
    // than that many individual results: one broken rule fails hundreds of cases, and what you
    // need to see is the rule, not the roll call.
