// Every question a panel asks about a remote session has to reach the client
// that actually holds the answer.
//
// **This is the bug class that cost the most and showed the least.** There is
// one accessor that decides which client a panel talks to — MirrorClientFor —
// and CB-69 taught it to prefer the direct link. What CB-69 did not do was go
// looking for the callers that went *around* it and read the relay table
// directly. That was the same thing while a relay was the only client there
// was, and stopped being the same thing the moment the link arrived.
//
// The failure has no error in it. StateFor is never asked, so it answers
// Unknown, and the panel says "checking whether a live view is available…" and
// means it — forever, with the roster arriving every ten seconds the whole
// time. It was found by a person clicking an orb.
//
// The relay table is gone (CB-238), and with it the particular way around the
// accessor that bit CB-69. The way around it now would be to read
// PeerSessions.Host directly, which is what the guard below watches for.
