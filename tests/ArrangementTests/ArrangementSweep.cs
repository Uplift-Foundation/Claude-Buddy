    // The orb-geometry sweep, as a class rather than as a script.

    // The sweep itself is unchanged and predates this file: it walks every
    // shape, at every end of the spacing slider, across the orb counts and team
    // shapes that actually occur, and asserts the things that kept going wrong —
    // orbs off the screen, orbs drawn on top of each other, teams fanned so far
    // from their lead that the arrows stopped being drawn, and arrangements that
    // threw rather than drew. Then it walks the whole thing again with a saved
    // anchor, the input that says "draw the shape here" instead of in the middle
    // of the screen.
    //
    // **Why it moved out of Program.cs.** tests/ArrangementTests is a plain
    // console exe, not a test-SDK project, so it contributes nothing to
    // tools/coverage.sh — OrbArrangement.cs read 0.0% while being the most
    // exhaustively verified file in the repo, and CLAUDE.md called that out as a
    // number to distrust rather than a gap to fill. Splitting the cases and the
    // invariants away from the printing lets tests/UnitTests compile this file
    // in and run the same sweep as a real test, which puts those lines in the
    // denominator where they belong.
    //
    // Two consumers, deliberately: `dotnet run --project tests/ArrangementTests`
    // still prints the grouped failure report that makes a regression readable
    // by hand, and the xUnit suite asserts the same list is empty. Neither owns
    // a private copy of the matrix, which is the point — a case added here is
    // added to both at once.
