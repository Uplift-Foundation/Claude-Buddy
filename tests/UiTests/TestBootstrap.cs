// Every [AvaloniaFact] in this assembly shares one Avalonia application and

// instance to isolate them. xUnit's default is to run different test
// classes as separate collections in parallel, on separate threads, which
// against a single shared dispatcher means real concurrent construction of
// Window objects from multiple threads — a plausible contributor to the
// intermittent KeyNotFoundException for "fonts:SystemFonts" documented on
// TestAppBuilder.WarmUpFontManager.
//
// On its own, this setting did NOT stop that failure recurring in CI
// (confirmed by reproducing it on real hardware with this exact setting in
// place) — it is one piece of a defense-in-depth stack alongside the
// warm-up and the CI-level retry (see ci.yml), not a fix by itself. Kept
// because it can only reduce the odds of a documented, still-not-fully-
// understood upstream race, never increase them, and disabling
// parallelization costs nothing here — 108 tests across three suites run
// in under two seconds regardless.

// OrbweaverSettings.Directory is a static property read lazily, but the
// model behind it (OrbweaverSettings.Load) is cached for the process once
// read — see OrbweaverSettings.ReloadForTests's own comment. The danger
// this heads off is real and cheap to hit by accident: OrbWindow's
// constructor has a field initializer,
// `private readonly SolidColorBrush _orbBrush = new(OrbColors.Idle);`,
// which reads OrbweaverSettings.IdleColor the moment an OrbWindow is
// constructed — before a test method's own body runs a single statement.
// Point ORBWEAVER_SETTINGS_DIR at a fresh, private scratch directory
// before that happens, or the very first OrbWindow built anywhere in this
// suite reads (and, on a save, writes) the developer's real settings.json.
//
// [ModuleInitializer] runs once per assembly load, ahead of any test
// collection, and ahead of the Avalonia headless bootstrap in
// TestAppBuilder — both of which is required, since AppBuilder.Configure
// touches OrbweaverSettings too (App.axaml.cs reads it while composing
// styles).
