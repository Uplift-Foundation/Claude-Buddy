// The scan's subprocess questions, through a real SessionManager: who owns
// each claimed tmux pane, what the daemon lists, who is attached, and which
// `claude agents` window watches a directory.
//
// These were answered on the UI thread, one pane at a time, until profiling a
// real machine found the dispatcher about 66% busy and inside
// TerminalFocuser.TmuxPaneOwner in six snapshots of six. ScheduleScan now
// answers them in its background half, and the reconciliation half on the UI
// thread only reads them. The first case here is the regression check for that
// move. The others check that moving the questions kept the answers in use:
// a stale pane claim is still dropped, a claim nobody could verify still is
// not, and a pid-less lead still adopts its viewer's pane.
//
// Every seam is handed over, so nothing here runs tmux, ps, lsof or `claude`.
