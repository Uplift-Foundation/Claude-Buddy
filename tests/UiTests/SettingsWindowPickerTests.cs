// The settings rows that are a dropdown or a slider rather than a switch.
//
// Driven through the control each builder returns rather than by hunting the
// visual tree, for the reason the switch tests give: what a row actually holds
// depends on which theme templates loaded, so finding it by walking the tree
// tests the theme. Each builder hands back its own control, so a test can change
// the control's value and watch the setting follow.
//
// Safe to drive, and worth checking why. Every handler here either writes a
// setting or calls SessionManager.Instance?.ReapplyArrangement() — and under the
// headless lifetime App never starts a SessionManager, so Instance is null and
// that call is a no-op. Nothing else in these rows reaches the OS. The voice
// pickers are deliberately not driven: opening one enumerates the machine's
// voices, which launches `say`.
