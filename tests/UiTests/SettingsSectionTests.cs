// restated: the window is built through its private constructor, never shown
// and never closed — closing a headless Window corrupts a process-wide Avalonia
// font cache and takes every later test in the assembly with it — and nothing
// here synthesizes a click, because there is no gesture in this commit to
// synthesize. These drive the builder and read the tree it produced.
