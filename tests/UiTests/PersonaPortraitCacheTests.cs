// The decoded-picture cache, driven from the scan rather than from a persona
// handed over by hand.
//
// LocalPersonaScanTests already proves the scan notices a portrait replaced in
// place and puts the new bytes in the registry. That is only half of what a
// user sees. OpenClawAvatars keeps one decoded Avatar per key, and an orb draws
// whatever is in that cache — so new bytes in the registry and a stale entry in
// the cache still puts the old face on the screen, and the two failures are
// indistinguishable from anywhere except here.
//
// It lives in tests/UiTests because that is the only suite where the decode
// actually happens: OpenClawAvatars.For builds an Avalonia WriteableBitmap, and
// in a process with no Avalonia behind it every decode returns null and every
// assertion below would pass against a cache that was never dropped. The same
// reason ChatPanelAvatarTests and OrbAvatarTests are here.
//
// [AvaloniaFact] rather than [Fact], and that is the whole reason this file is
// not in tests/IntegrationTests: the decode ends in a WriteableBitmap, which
// needs the platform up. Without it every decode returns null, both assertions
// below hold trivially, and the suite would report a cache it never touched.
// No window is constructed all the same.
//
// The user-level config directories are pinned here for CB-143's reason, and
// AnUntouchedPortraitKeepsItsDecodedFrames is why this file cares rather than
// only tests/IntegrationTests. ApplyPersona used to ask
// LocalPersona.UserConfigDirs on every pass, which reads CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and
// ClaudeCodeProfileDirs; either one moving between two passes lengthens the
// candidate list, changes the signature, resolves the persona again and hands
// the registry a new object — and a new object is precisely what makes
// LocalPersonas.Set drop the decoded bitmap. So the shared-state coupling and
// the cost this file measures are the same fact seen twice: a portrait
// re-decoded on every tick, per session, on a machine running twenty or thirty
// agents. Pinning the provider is what makes the claim below about the cache
// rather than about what else was running.
//
// [Collection("Settings")] is kept, both because the cases here write settings
// of their own and as a second line behind the pin. The cache and the registry
// are process-wide too, so each case uses its own session id and cleans up
// after itself.
