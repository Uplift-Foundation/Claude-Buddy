// A real scan, over real status files, producing real orb windows.
//
// This is the seam the rest of SessionManager's tests stop at: Superseded,
// JudgeLiveness and the rest are pure and covered in tests/UnitTests, but
// nothing there proves the scan wires them to a window — that a file appearing
// puts an orb on screen, that deleting it takes the orb away with its status
// and its place in the stacking order, or that expiring one does the same. Those
// are the failures a user actually reports ("I seem to have lost all my orbs"),
// and every one of them lives in the plumbing rather than in the rules.
//
// Two things make it runnable without touching the machine it runs on.
//
// The status directory is handed over rather than inherited: SessionManager's
// internal constructor takes one, so these files land in a scratch directory of
// this test's own and a real session's orb is never disturbed. Start() is
// deliberately never called — it would create a TrayController, subscribe to the
// speech engine and start a two-second timer, none of which this is about, and
// with no tray attached UpdateTray becomes a no-op on a null.
//
// And every fake session is shaped so that nothing here shells out. Both
// BackgroundJobs.IsLiveJob (`claude agents --json`) and AgentTeamViewer.TryAdopt
// are reached only by a session with no terminal or no pid, so every file below
// names both — a term_program and this test process's own pid, which is the one
// pid on the machine that is certainly alive. Two files never share a pid *and*
// a CLI either, which is what would put Superseded's job-list lookup in play.
// The rules those calls sit behind are covered in ScanVerdictTests, where they
// are passed in rather than performed.
