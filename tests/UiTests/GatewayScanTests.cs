// A scan that has gateway sessions in it, and the room orbs it invents from them.
//
// Same harness as SessionScanTests next door — SessionManager's internal
// constructor takes a scratch status directory and Start() is never called — with
// one addition: the gateway snapshot is published through a test seam, because the
// only thing that publishes one in production is the poll loop, which needs a live
// socket and is excluded.
//
// The snapshot itself is built by handing real sessions.list JSON to
// OpenClawSessions.Parse, rather than constructing Session records by hand. That
// way the test travels the route a real poll does and cannot drift into asserting
// a shape the gateway never sends.
//
// What is being tested is the thing the gateway has no notion of. It reports a
// session per agent per channel, so eight agents in one room are eight orbs with
// nothing saying they are the same conversation — the room orb is invented here,
// once, however many agents point at it.
