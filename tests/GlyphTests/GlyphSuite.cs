    // The orb-initials cases, as a class rather than as a script.
    //
    // The cases themselves are not new and nothing here changes one. They moved
    // out of Program.cs for the same reason the arrangement sweep did: this
    // project is a plain console exe with no test SDK reference, so
    // tools/coverage.sh never saw it, and OrbGlyph reported 40% coverage from
    // incidental use elsewhere while actually being checked here in detail.
    // tests/UnitTests compiles this file in and runs the identical tables, so
    // the lines land in the denominator and `dotnet run --project
    // tests/GlyphTests` keeps working.
    //
    // Why this suite exists at all is worth repeating where the cases live: the
    // initials were wrong for a year without anyone noticing. Every kebab-case
    // directory drew two letters off the front of its first word, so
    // "claude-buddy" was "Cl" when it should have been "Cb". It was invisible
    // partly because it only looks wrong when the two halves start with
    // different letters, and partly because the only way to see the answer was
    // to look at the screen.
    //
    // Cases stay grouped by the reason each one is here rather than by input, so
    // a failure says which rule broke and not merely which string moved.
