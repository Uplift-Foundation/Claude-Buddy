// CB-170: an OpenClaw orb's right-click menu with its two gateway rows, in
// the three states a reviewer needs to see — offered, End armed, and End
// refused with the gateway's own sentence on the row.
//
// The real menu, opened on a shown orb, rather than its rows copied into a
// stand-in window: the thing under review is where the rows sit among the
// others and what they say there. The clicks go through the orb's seams, never
// the pointer — the same rule as OrbWindowScreenshots, whose pointer handling
// would reach TerminalFocuser — and the actions are fakes, so no gateway is
// involved.
