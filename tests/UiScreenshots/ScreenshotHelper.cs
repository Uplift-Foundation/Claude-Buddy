    // Scoped to the capture path on purpose. The app draws through the
    // compositor onto a real window surface, where LCD is ordinary ClearType
    // and correct; its only two RenderTargetBitmap uses (a chat-panel arrow
    // and a menu swatch) draw lines and ellipses, no text. Nothing a Windows
    // user sees is changed by this, and a screenshot suite that quietly
    // changed it would be showing something the app does not do.
