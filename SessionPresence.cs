        //   of the two shapes BackgroundJobs' own comment says only the daemon
        //   can settle: an Agent-View-dispatched background session does not fork
        //   a process, it starts a second conversation inside the one `claude`

        //   session's pid. Left out, the gate above refused to ask about exactly

        //   before this is asked and then reads as an ordinary session.
