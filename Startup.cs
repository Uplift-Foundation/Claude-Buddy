        // (Dispatcher.ThreadStorage.cs), and that constructs
        // `new Dispatcher(null)` *on the calling thread*, whose constructor does
        // `s_uiThread ??= this`. Whichever thread touches it first owns the UI
        // thread for the life of the process. Nothing about the call site says
        // so, which is why this has a name and forty lines of comment rather
        // than being a bare `_ =` in Main.

        //     -> setup succeeds, and the callback queued before startup runs
        //        once the dispatcher pumps.

        // macOS platform init (AvaloniaNativePlatform.Initialize) calls
        // Dispatcher.InitializeUIThreadDispatcher, whose first act is
        // UIThread.VerifyAccess(). If a pool thread got there first, that throws
        // and takes the process with it.

        // **The mechanism this comment used to describe no longer exists, and
        // it is removed rather than re-pointed at a surviving class.** It named
        // RemoteControlSessions.StartAsync reaching a
        // `Dispatcher.UIThread.Post(EnsureTimer)` after an awaited
        // `bridge.StartAsync()`, so that post landed on the pool. Neither
        // method has a definition anywhere any more — both went with the
        // bridge and survive only in comments; ServePump.cs's header has the
        // rest of what went with it. Naming a dead path as the reason for a
        // live ordering requirement is worse than naming no path at all, and
        // re-homing it to whichever class looks like the closest fit would
        // have been the same mistake with a live class in it.
        //
        // **Nor is there a surviving race to re-home it to.** The sequence
        // below runs synchronously on this thread, so the dispatcher has an
        // owner before `serveOnLaunch` can spawn anything that might post to
        // it — and in fact before this step, since `installCrashLog` subscribes
        // to `Dispatcher.UIThread.UnhandledException` (CrashLog.cs, whose own
        // comment says the same thing from the other side: that subscribe
        // would be enough on its own, and the claim is kept as its own step so
        // that reading that line never becomes load-bearing). Nothing in
        // production touches the dispatcher at type-load either — no module
        // initializer, no static constructor — so a pool thread cannot get
        // there first.
        //
        // What remains is the reason the claim is hoisted out to here at all,
        // and it is not contingent on any particular caller: `serveOnLaunch` is
        // the first thing in the sequence that can touch the dispatcher from a
        // thread that is not this one, and this runs before it. On an ordinary
        // machine Main would be inside StartWithClassicDesktopLifetime by then
        // and would have claimed it anyway; on a machine whose screen never
        // unlocks Main is asleep in WaitForUnlock and cannot have. That
        // asymmetry is the whole of it — and a reported lock now waits up to
        // twelve hours rather than two (see ScreenLockWait), so this step
        // covers a longer stretch than it used to. Longer is not riskier here:
        // posts simply queue for longer against a dispatcher that already has
        // an owner.

        // it is a static field read.

        // The point is the sequence, which is the fix: the claim has to happen
        // before anything that could post from another thread, and everything
        // Buddy starts before the UI is up can. Writing crashes down comes
        // before even that, because the first thing worth recording is a failure
        // in the startup below it — the two crashes that prompted all of this
        // happened inside `startUi` and left nothing behind (CB-44).
        // `serveOnLaunch` brings up the peer link and the gateway and cloud
        // pollers, whose continuations land on the pool; `waitForUnlock` then
        // holds this thread for as long as the screen stays locked, up to
        // twelve hours, which is all the time those continuations need and
        // then some. Starting the UI
        // last is the shape that already existed and is what makes the first
        // three worth ordering at all.
        //
        // `claimSingleInstance` sits between `installCrashLog` and
        // `claimUiThread`, and both sides of that placement matter (CB-178).
        // After `installCrashLog`, so that a genuinely unexpected failure in
        // the claim itself (not the ordinary "someone else holds it" answer —
        // an actual thrown exception) still gets written down. Before
        // everything else, including `claimUiThread`, because a duplicate
        // instance should do *nothing* else: not claim the UI thread, not
        // start a relay, not touch the screen-lock wait. It used to run
        // inside Avalonia startup instead — see App.axaml.cs's history and
        // SingleInstance.cs's header comment — where the loser called
        // `desktop.Shutdown()` after Avalonia had already begun unwinding
        // toward `Dispatcher.MainLoop`, which is what turned "another Buddy
        // is running" into an uncaught `InvalidOperationException` and a
        // SIGABRT. A step that can return `false` and stop the sequence
        // before any of that exists is the fix: nothing after this line runs
        // for the loser, so there is no dispatcher left for anything to shut
        // down.
        //
        // `migrateUserData` (CB-255) sits straight after the claim and before
        // `claimUiThread`, and again both sides matter. After, because it moves
        // the user's data folder from the legacy name to the new one, and two
        // processes moving one directory at once is exactly the race the claim
        // — on both mutex names, see SingleInstance.ClaimNames — exists to
        // prevent; a duplicate never gets this far. Before everything else,
        // because `serveOnLaunch` is the first thing that reads settings, the
        // peer identity and the speech engine's folder, and all three have to
        // find the migrated folder rather than create an empty new one.
        // `installCrashLog` is the one step ahead of it that can touch the new
        // folder (the log directory is computed per access), which is why the
        // migration merges logs rather than assuming the new folder is absent.
        //
        // `retireLegacy` (CB-255) runs after the migration — the legacy hook
        // folder on Windows also holds the legacy Logs folder, which the
        // migration has to have moved out first — and after `claimUiThread`, so
        // that nothing it grows into (the macOS stale-bundle cleanup raises a
        // tray notice) can be the first thing to touch the dispatcher. It is
        // still ahead of `serveOnLaunch` and well ahead of `startUi`.
        //
        // `repairKeepAlive` (CB-256) comes straight after `retireLegacy`, and
        // the order between the two is the point: the keep-alive plist can
        // name the legacy Claude Buddy.app, which is stale the moment that
        // step trashes it, and running second lets one launch catch both.
        // After the single-instance claim, because the script it runs loads
        // the LaunchAgent and launchd starts a copy at once — which must find
        // this one holding the mutex and exit 0, not race it for the data
        // folder. Before `serveOnLaunch`, like the other retirement steps:
        // nothing it does needs the network or a screen.
        //
        // Passed as delegates rather than called directly because every one of
        // them is unrunnable in a test — a real relay, a real screen-lock query,
        // a real named mutex, and a lifetime that owns the process until it
        // exits — while the order (and, now, the short-circuit) is the part
        // that broke and the part a test can hold on to.
