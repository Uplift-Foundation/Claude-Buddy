    // CB-115: recovers a delivered picture's real path when OpenClaw's cron
    // delivery route has already stripped both the "MEDIA:" prefix and the
    // directory out of the transcript, leaving a caption and a bare filename
    // with no directory at all:
    //
    //   sunset over the harbour today 🌇
    //   poster_harbour_sunset_10000001.png
    //
    // LocalMediaPathFrom cannot resolve that today (see its own comment): a
    // MEDIA: line only counts when it is a line of its own, and the bare-path
    // arm only fires when the ENTIRE trimmed text is nothing but the path — a
    // caption sharing the message with it fails both. 13 of Owner's 14
    // pictures in main's DM failed this way.
    //
    // The original string survives elsewhere, though: the cron run record
    // that produced the message. Every automation turn carries
    //
    //   "openclawAutomation": {"kind":"cron","jobId":"3c29d831-…","runId":"…"}
    //
    // and `cron.runs {"jobId": …}` — declared `operator.read` in the
    // gateway's own dist/method-scopes-K6J_UQGL.js, unlike every mutating
    // cron.* method, which needs operator.admin — answers with a page of that
    // job's history, each entry carrying the very `summary` the agent
    // originally produced, MEDIA: line and all.
    //
    // ---- Matching: basename within the job, not runId/timestamp ----
    //
    // The first version of this matched on time: parse the trailing
    // milliseconds off `runId` and pick the run whose `runAtMs` was the
    // greatest value at or before it, within a tolerance. That was wrong on
    // its own terms even measured against real data — `runId`'s suffix and
    // the matching entry's `runAtMs` differ by 65 ms, so an equality match
    // finds nothing and looks like the whole approach failed — and it was
    // wrong in a second way that only showed up thinking past today's
    // measurement: the tolerance it needed ("a few seconds is unambiguous
    // because runs are ~25 minutes apart") is a property of Owner's cron
    // schedule, not of the mechanism, and a job firing every 30 seconds would
    // collapse it silently. Scrapped mid-flight rather than kept as a
    // fallback — `runId` is not read anywhere in this file.
    //
    // What is actually unique is simpler and needs no tunable at all: the
    // bare filename in the transcript is *itself* the thing being resolved,
    // and it is unique within one job's run history. Measured against the
    // real jobId this was built against (`.cb115-evidence/cron-runs-live-capture.json`
    // holds one page of it): of 51 runs, 35 carry a MEDIA: path, 35 distinct
    // basenames, zero collisions — every one of main's bare-filename captions
    // matched uniquely.
    //
    // So the match is: read every run's `summary` through the *existing*
    // LocalMediaPathFrom (no new parser — this ticket supplies a better
    // input, not a new arm), take the basename of whatever path comes back,
    // and find the one entry (per job) whose basename equals the transcript's.
    // A collision — two different full paths sharing one basename inside a
    // job — is refused rather than guessed, the same rule
    // OpenClawSessions.MediaPathsByFileName already applies to duplicate
    // basenames and for the same reason: showing the wrong picture is worse
    // than showing none. Not observed once in the real corpus; the refusal
    // exists for the day it is.
    //
    // ---- Paging: a small limit silently drops old runs ----
    //
    // An early capture of this job's runs used limit:5 and held only 4 of the
    // 35 real MEDIA: paths — a shorter job history, silently, with no error
    // and no empty result to notice. A picture scrolled back to must not fail
    // merely because its run fell off the first page, so the RPC layer that
    // calls this (OpenClawSessions.RecoverCronMediaPathAsync) keeps paging on
    // `nextOffset` until `hasMore` is false or a bounded number of pages is
    // spent, and caches the whole accumulated map rather than one page's
    // worth at a time.
    //
    // ---- Trigger: three conjuncts, checked at two different call sites ----
    //
    //   openclawAutomation.kind == "cron"
    //     AND the message's trailing whitespace-separated token is
    //         image-shaped (a bare filename with an image extension, or a
    //         rooted/~ path with one)
    //     AND the turn has no resolved image yet
    //
    // Not "any turn carrying openclawAutomation": measured, all 14 of main's
    // picture turns carry `openclawAutomation.kind == "cron"`, including one
    // whose caption pairs with a rooted path rather than a bare filename — a
    // shape a future fix to caption+path recognition (CB-107) would resolve
    // directly, without ever reaching this file. Gating on the *outcome*
    // rather than the key's presence means that turn stops costing a lookup
    // the moment the earlier arm starts succeeding, with nothing here to
    // revisit when that lands — and it means the trigger fires identically
    // whether or not CB-107 is present, since "no resolved image yet" is true
    // in both worlds until something upstream of this file actually resolves
    // one.
    //
    // And not "any automation turn, resolved or not": a text-only cron job —
    // a heartbeat, a status post — carries the same
    // `openclawAutomation.kind == "cron"` and would otherwise cost an RPC on
    // every single reply for a job that never once mentions a picture. The
    // image-shape check is the second conjunct precisely to exclude that
    // population; it costs nothing to check and excludes nothing in main's
    // corpus today (a picture-delivery job's every turn already ends in a
    // filename), but it is not free to skip for a job that looks different.
    //
    // The rooted case reuses OpenClawSessions.LooksLikeAnImagePath, already
    // present for LocalMediaPathFrom's own bare-path arm. The bare-filename
    // case has no existing predicate to reuse — 290d086 (this ticket's base)
    // carries LooksLikeAnImagePath but not a bare-filename twin, which is
    // CB-107's to add — so LooksLikeABareImageFilename below is new. If
    // CB-107 lands, that predicate and this one are the same idea reached
    // from two directions and should be reconciled to one; this file does
    // not depend on CB-107 existing.
    //
    // ---- Pure, like OpenClawMediaSource ----
    //
    // Everything in this file is parsing and matching over values already in
    // hand — no window, no settings, no socket. The RPC call itself
    // (OpenClawSessions.RecoverCronMediaPathAsync) is the only excluded half,
    // the same split CB-109's OpenClawMediaSource and CB-88's
    // LocalMediaPathFrom already use.
