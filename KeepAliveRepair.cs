    // Re-points the crash keep-alive LaunchAgent when the program it names is
    // gone, by running the bundle's own install-hooks.sh --keepalive-only
    // (CB-256 §2, the design's risk #1).
    //
    // **Why this has to exist at all.** The keep-alive plist written by
    // install-hooks.sh names one executable path, and phase 3 renamed the
    // executable: a phase-2 install's plist says
    // Orbweaver.app/Contents/MacOS/ClaudeBuddy, and a phase-3 bundle has only
    // Contents/MacOS/Orbweaver. `build-macos-app.sh --install` and the DMG's
    // "Install Hooks.command" both rewrite the plist, but a user who drags the
    // new Orbweaver.app over the old one and never re-runs Install Hooks keeps
    // a LaunchAgent pointing at a file that no longer exists. launchd logs "No
    // such file", gives up, and the app runs only when someone starts it by
    // hand. The machine this hurts is exactly the one nobody is looking at —
    // the headless mini under launchd — and nobody reading release notes is
    // the user it hurts, by construction. Neither phase-2 mechanism notices:
    // MacOSLegacyBundle only ever looks at Claude Buddy.app.
    //
    // **It runs the script rather than rewriting the plist itself**, so there
    // is one implementation of reconcile_keepalive, not two to keep in step.
    // The bundled copy, Contents/Resources/install-hooks.sh, resolves the
    // bundle it sits in first, so the plist it writes names this executable;
    // it also re-reads "Serve on launch", so a stale plist for a setting since
    // turned off is removed rather than revived. Its output goes to
    // migration.log, beside what DataDirMigration and MacOSLegacyBundle say
    // they did.
    //
    // **The rule is narrow on purpose.** It acts only when the plist is ours
    // (its Label is Brand.MacBundleId), the program it names is missing, and
    // this process is running from a bundle — the last because there is no
    // bundled script to run otherwise, and a loose `dotnet run` binary is not
    // something launchd should be pointed at. A plist whose program exists is
    // left alone however it got there: the repair is for "dead", not for
    // "different". Once the script has rewritten it the program exists, so
    // this is a no-op on every launch after the one that repaired it.
    //
    // **What one repair does not do.** Loading the job makes launchd start a
    // copy straight away (SuccessfulExit=false implies RunAtLoad); that copy
    // finds this one holding the single-instance mutex and exits 0, which the
    // keep-alive takes at its word. So until the job is next loaded — the
    // next login — the running app is not launchd's child, and a crash of it
    // is not restarted. A repaired keep-alive, not an instantly armed one;
    // making it instant would mean this process stepping aside for launchd's,
    // which is not a thing a startup step should do on its own.
    //
    // Runs from Startup.Run's `repairKeepAlive` step, after `retireLegacy`: a
    // plist naming the legacy Claude Buddy.app is stale the moment
    // MacOSLegacyBundle trashes that bundle, and this catches it in the same
    // launch. Does nothing off macOS and nothing while any of
    // DataDirMigration.OverrideVariables is set, which every test suite does.
    // Never throws.
