    // This replaces MirrorProtocol's wire format, and the difference is worth
    // stating plainly because it is the whole reason for the change. That format
    // carried a transcript as 6KB chunks of base64, each with its own SHA-256
    // and a whole-payload digest on top, sized so that a *language model* could
    // retype it into a peer-messaging tool. Measured on two real machines: 222,
    // 231, 234, 247 and 192 seconds for a single chunk, and at least once the
    // model got a character wrong and the digest correctly refused the result.
    //
    // None of that is needed here. A TLS stream is ordered, framed and integrity
    // checked by construction, so what goes on the wire is the JSON itself:
    //
    //   * **No chunking.** A window is one message. A 500KB transcript is one
    //     read rather than a four-minute hand-copy.
    //   * **No base64.** JSON strings carry text; there is no model in the path
    //     to be confused by punctuation.
    //   * **No digests.** TLS already detects a mangled byte, and a mangled byte
    //     is a broken connection rather than a frame to re-request.
    //
    // What is kept is the *vocabulary* — hello, roster, fetch, window, watch,
    // delta, input, ok, err — because those decisions are sound and are what
    // RemoteMirrorServer already knows how to answer.
