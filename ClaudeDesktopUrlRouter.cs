    // Delivery is `/usr/bin/open -a <bundle path> [--env ...] <url>`, the same
    // command the launcher already uses, and deliberately *without* -n. -n is
    // right when launching a profile, because the caller has just proved
    // nothing is running on that directory; here the opposite is wanted — an
    // already-running instance should receive the link, and starting a second
    // Chromium on a live userData directory is the leveldb corruption the whole
    // profile feature exists to avoid. Verified on a real machine: `open -a`
    // against a clone path delivered to the running instance and started
    // nothing new.
