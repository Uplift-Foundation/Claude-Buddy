    // Neither platform refreshes it on upgrade. On macOS the script is copied to
    // ~/.claude/orbweaver/ by install-macos-hooks.sh, which only runs when
    // somebody re-wires; on Windows it is copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Orbweaver\ by
    // install-windows-hooks.ps1, which the installer runs only when the
    // "wirehooks" task is ticked. A change to the hook therefore reaches new
    // installs and nobody else, which is how a hook that records a new field
    // can ship and be silently absent from every upgraded machine.
    //
    // What this does about it is deliberately small: at startup, if a copy of the
    // script is already installed and differs from the one bundled with this
    // build, overwrite it. It never creates a missing copy — a first install is
    // the user's choice and a machine that never wired hooks must stay that way —
    // and it never touches settings.json or any Codex or Grok configuration. The
    // script file is the only thing it writes.
    //
    // Which copy: every candidate that exists. settings.json invokes whichever
    // path the last installer wrote, and an upgraded machine can still be
    // pointing at the pre-rename ClaudeBuddyHook.* (confirmed on a real Mac: its
    // settings.json invokes ~/.claude/claude-buddy/ClaudeBuddyHook.sh and
    // ~/.claude/orbweaver does not exist). Refreshing a path nothing invokes is
    // harmless; failing to refresh the one that is invoked defeats the point. The
    // bundled script has the same content under either name — it does not read
    // its own filename — so the legacy path receives the same bytes.
