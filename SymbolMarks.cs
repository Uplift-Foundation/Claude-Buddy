    // Why drawn at all (CB-171, CB-173): every one of these has a Unicode
    // character, and every one of those characters reaches the screen through
    // font fallback, which picks a different face per platform. Measured with
    // the same SKFontManager.MatchCharacter call Avalonia's TryMatchCharacter
    // makes, on the real Windows box and on a Mac: U+23F1, U+2699, U+2601,
    // U+23F9 and U+2328 all land on Segoe UI Emoji on Windows, a colour font,
    // so the glyph arrives at its own size and in its own colours and ignores
    // the Foreground the control asked for. macOS gives the same characters a
    // monochrome face (STIX Two Math, Menlo, Hiragino Sans). U+21C4 went to
    // Segoe UI Symbol on the box and to Segoe UI Emoji on the CI runner, which
    // is the other reason not to trust a character: which face wins varies by
    // machine as well as by platform. A path is drawn in the Fill it is given,
    // at the size it is given, on both.
    //
    // "The character resolves" was never the test — CB-171's cloud resolved
    // fine on both platforms and still drew nothing a person would read as a
    // cloud. The test is what reaches the screen at 13px, in the colour asked
    // for, on both rids; tests/UiScreenshots captures each of these so the two
    // can be compared side by side.
    //
    // Every mark is fat on purpose. At 13px one unit of this box is about 0.8
    // of a pixel, so a stroke under two units is a hairline that antialiasing
    // turns to grey, and a gap under one unit closes up. They are designed at
    // that size rather than shrunk to it.
    //
    // Pure strings and pure functions of an enum, so the unit suite can hold
    // them without a render interface. Parsing needs one, which is why the parse-and-bounds
    // check lives in tests/UiTests.
