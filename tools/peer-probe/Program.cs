using ClaudeBuddy;

// Drives the peer link from a terminal: connect to a paired machine, ask what
// it has, and fetch one session's transcript.
//
// **This exists because the panel is the only other way to ask, and a panel
// needs a mouse, an unlocked screen and a person.** The plan that replaced the
// relay called for it in as many words — "what makes the far side diagnosable
// without a mouse" — and it replaces tools/mirror-probe, which drove the relay
// and went with it.
//
// It runs the *shipped* PeerLink and the *shipped* RemoteMirrorClient rather
// than a second copy of either. A probe that spoke the protocol its own way
// could answer a question the app would answer differently, which is the one
// thing a diagnostic must never do.
//
// Two things to know before reading the output.
//
// **It uses this machine's identity**, so it only reaches machines this Buddy
// has already paired with — it cannot pair, and it is not a way around the
// pairing code. Running it beside a live Buddy is fine: both present the same
// certificate, and the far side is happy to hold two connections.
//
// **On macOS it is subject to Local Network consent**, and a terminal usually
// has none where the signed app does. A probe that cannot connect while the app
// plainly can is telling you about the terminal, not the network — see CB-38,
// and the note in CLAUDE.md about ping and ssh being exempt and therefore
// useless as evidence here.
