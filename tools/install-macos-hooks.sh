# Installs the Orbweaver hook into Claude Code's macOS settings.
#
# The bash twin of tools/install-windows-hooks.ps1, and the reason it exists is
# the same: the hook is what makes orbs appear, and an app with no hook wired up
# doesn't error, it just sits there showing nothing. Hand-merging JSON into a
# settings.json that already holds your model, permissions and status line is
# both fiddly and easy to get wrong, so do it mechanically.
#
#   install-macos-hooks.sh              # install / repair
#   install-macos-hooks.sh --uninstall  # remove just our entries
#
# Extra Claude Code accounts — a second one run as
# `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work claude` — are separate settings.json files
# and invisible to the default wiring. Every directory name saved in the app's
# own settings ("Claude Code profiles" in the Settings window) is wired too, in
# addition to ~/.claude and never instead of it. That mirrors what
# install-windows-hooks.ps1 has always done; the two had drifted, and the macOS
# side was the half that silently left a second account unwired.
#
# Safe to re-run: it strips any existing entries of ours before adding fresh
# ones, so it converges rather than accumulating duplicates.
#
# "Ours" is either hook filename: OrbweaverHook.sh, or the ClaudeBuddyHook.sh
# every install before the rename wrote (CB-255). Stripping both in one pass is
# what moves an upgraded machine off the old script without a separate
# migration step, and what keeps a re-run convergent either way. The old
# ~/.claude/claude-buddy folder is deliberately left on disk: a Claude Code
# session already running read its hooks at start and keeps calling the old
# path until it is restarted. The folder gets a .superseded marker instead,
# which is what the app's LegacyHookCleanup reads to retire it 14 days later.
#
# Runs from either the repo (tools/install-macos-hooks.sh, hook script one level
# up) or from inside the installed app bundle (Contents/Resources, hook script
# right alongside), so the shipped .app can offer hook setup without the user
# needing a clone.
