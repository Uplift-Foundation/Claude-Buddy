;   iscc /DVersion=0.1.0-beta tools\Orbweaver.iss

; style utility that only ever touches the current user's Claude Code config, so
; a machine-wide install would buy nothing and cost an elevation dialog.

;
; Only in an administrative install. Adding a firewall rule needs elevation, and
; this installer defaults to PrivilegesRequired=lowest, a per-user install, where
; the step could only fail: netsh exited 1 on every per-user install measured on
; the Windows box. That exit code in the install log was also misread as Setup
; itself failing (CB-213). Skipping it there changes nothing about what the
; install achieves, since the rule could not be added either way; a per-user
; install is left to Windows Firewall's own first-listen prompt.
;
; Delete, delete, add. The first drops the rule an install from before the
; rename added under the old name, which would otherwise sit beside the new one
; naming the same exe. The second is what makes a re-run idempotent: netsh
; happily adds a second rule with the same name, so without it every upgrade
; stacks another copy. A delete of a rule that is not there exits 1, which is

{ CB-49: crash keep-alive, via a Scheduled Task that restarts the app when
  Windows logs an Application Error against it -- not a plain "Run" key,
  which only fires at logon and does nothing after a crash mid-session, and
  not the task's own "restart on failure" setting either, which only judges
  whether *launching* the task succeeded and has no way to notice that the
  long-running process it started later died. An event-log trigger is the
  standard way to get real crash-restart out of Task Scheduler for an
  ordinary EXE: Event ID 1000 from source "Application Error" fires whenever
  any process crashes, with the faulting executable's name in its AppName
  field, so the trigger below filters on that rather than firing for every
  crash on the machine.

  Gated on the same "Serve on launch" (Remote Control) setting macOS checks
  in install-hooks.sh, and for the same reason: a task that brings the app
  back after every exit, deliberate or not, is the "app that will not stay
  quit" CB-49 itself warns against, and only a machine already asked to keep
  serving should get that. ServeOnLaunchEnabled below does a hand-rolled
  substring check rather than a real JSON parse, because Pascal Script has
  no JSON support and this only needs one boolean out of the file. }

{ CB-256: stop a running copy of the app before anything is installed.

  CloseApplications=force has always done this for the current exe, but
  Restart Manager is only asked about files this installer is about to write,
  and since the rename the pre-rename exe is not one of them. Without this, an
  upgrade over a running pre-rename build leaves that process running out of
  its locked exe: the delete in [InstallDelete] fails silently, the old process
  keeps the legacy single-instance mutex, and the new exe that the post-install
  launch (or the next sign-in) starts finds the mutex taken and exits 0. The
  user sees an upgrade that did nothing, still running the old build.

  taskkill /F is the same blunt instrument the uninstaller already uses, and
  no ruder than Restart Manager's force: the app has nothing it must flush on
  the way out. A forced termination does not log Event 1000, so the pre-rename
  keep-alive task does not bring the old exe straight back.

  taskkill returns before the process is actually gone, so this polls until
  tasklist no longer lists the image, for up to ten seconds. If it is still
  there after that -- most plausibly a copy belonging to another user, which a
  per-user install has no rights to stop -- setup carries on regardless and
