# -lc reported it missing, and separately, the user's actual interactive
# shell is zsh, so a bash-only fix would have kept failing for exactly the
# case this whole feature targets. A plain "does this work in an interactive
# terminal" spot check can also be misleading here, since a shell spawned
# *from* an already-interactive session inherits its parent's already-correct
# PATH regardless of its own startup-file choice — the gap only shows up on
# a genuinely fresh invocation, which is exactly what `wsl.exe -d <distro>
# --` is.
#
# So: try the current (non-interactive) PATH first, then bash's interactive
# startup (~/.bashrc), then zsh's if zsh is even installed (~/.zshrc), then
# bash's login startup (~/.profile) as a last resort — first one to find it
# wins. Still one wsl.exe call: the fallback chain runs as a single compound
# command inside it, not as separate invocations.
