// Settles CB-164's last open question from a terminal, with a human present.
//
// ## What the question is
//
// CB-164 settled the load-bearing one — the Claude Code CLI's own stored token
// is accepted at `GET https://api.anthropic.com/v2/ccr-sessions`, returning 200
// with two headers and no cookie. What is left for this tool is everything that
// needs a real credential and a real roster: confirming the store still holds
// what we think it holds on a given machine, and capturing the *shape* of a
// payload without capturing anybody's session titles.
//
// It runs the shipped code — the same credential source the app uses, the same
// request builder, the same status mapping — so its answer is the app's answer
// rather than a second opinion.
//
// **The host matters and is the trap this ticket paid for.** Aimed at claude.ai,
// the identical request is answered by a Cloudflare challenge that looks exactly
// like an auth failure — the same 403 for a real token and a bogus one. If this
// tool ever reports something that reads as "the account is not allowed", check
// the host before checking the account.
//
// ## Why it is a separate binary rather than something the app does
//
// Two reasons, and both are about consent.
//
// On macOS, reading the credential raises a Keychain prompt naming the calling
// binary. Running this is a deliberate act by a person at a keyboard who can see
// that prompt and answer it. The app must not take that step on anybody's behalf
// before the feature is opted into, and nothing built on top of this file may
// ship reading a credential by default.
//
// The prompt this raises names *this binary*, not Claude Buddy — it is a
// separate unsigned executable. That is expected and is not the rule the app
// follows being bent: the P/Invoke-rather-than-`security` argument in
// MacOSKeychain is about what the shipped, signed app puts on that screen. A
// grant given to the probe is a grant to the probe, and it does not carry over.
//
// And an agent must not run this. CB-164's own investigation had two attempts to
// reach the credential refused by a safety classifier, and neither was worked
// around; that refusal stands. The code below reads a credential when a *human*
// runs it.
//
// ## What it never prints
//
// No subcommand prints a token. `read` prints its length and first four
// characters at most, which is enough to tell "we read something plausible" from
// "we read an empty string" and not enough to be a credential. `list --shape`
// prints field names and JSON types with every value stripped, so a fixture for
// the roster parser can be designed without a single session title — several of
// which, per this ticket, are personal.
