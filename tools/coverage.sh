#   tools/coverage.sh --base upstream/develop   # ...plus coverage of new lines
#
# Two collectors, not one, and that is not an accident:
#
#   * tests/UnitTests and tests/IntegrationTests run on VSTest, so they use
#     coverlet.collector via `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`.
#   * tests/UiTests and tests/UiScreenshots run on the Microsoft Testing
#     Platform (both had to move to xUnit v3 for Avalonia.Headless.XUnit 12.x —
#     see their csprojs), and VSTest data collectors do not apply there at all.
#     They use Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage's own `--coverage`
#     instead.
#
# That package is version-pinned for the same class of reason as everything else
# in that csproj: 18.x depends on Microsoft.Testing.Platform 2.x, while
# xunit.v3 3.2.2 brings the mtp-v1 packages, and mixing them throws
# TypeLoadException for IDataConsumer before a single test runs. 17.14.2 is the
# newest that shares platform v1. If you bump xunit.v3, re-check this pin.
#
# The three suites above (ArrangementTests, GlyphTests, TranscriptTests) are
# plain console exes, not test-SDK projects, so they contribute nothing here —
# their coverage of OrbArrangement/OrbGlyph/ChatTranscript is real but invisible
# to this number. Read it as "coverage from the xUnit suites", not as the sum of
# everything this repo verifies.

# agents each in its own git worktree, and every one of them is told to measure
# coverage — same machine, same TMPDIR, one directory. The failure is silent and
# it lies in both directions: a run that wipes the shared directory mid-flight
# leaves the merge reading whichever reports happen to exist, so a suite that
# passed can be missing from the number entirely, and one worktree's hits can be
# attributed to another's source.

# A red suite must not stop the others being measured -- `set -e` used to abort

# Each suite's whole output, kept (CB-239). The terminal still gets only the
# last two lines of a suite — a green run is exactly as quiet as it was — but
# those two lines are the summary, and on a red run the summary is the part
# that does not say *which* tests failed. Piping straight into `tail -2` threw
# the rest away, so a Windows run with nine red UiTests could say how many
# and never which. The log lives beside the reports, in this checkout's own
# $OUT, and is replaced on the next run like everything else there.
LOGS=()

# The failing test names, from what each runner actually leaves behind.
#
# VSTest (UnitTests, IntegrationTests) prints `[xUnit.net 00:00:01.70]  <name>
# [FAIL]` into the suite's own output, so those come out of the log. The
# Microsoft Testing Platform suites (UiTests, UiScreenshots) print no per-test
# line at all under `dotnet test` — only the Failed! summary and a pointer to a
# TestResults .log that does not name the test either, measured on macOS and
# on the Windows box — so for them the names come from the xUnit report each
# run now writes, `<test ... name="..." result="Fail">`, with the entities a
# theory's arguments are escaped with turned back into characters.
#
# dotnet on Windows writes CRLF, and a bare `$` after the name would miss every
# line in silence; the `[[:space:]]*` before it swallows the \r, and
# tools/test-coverage-sh.py pins that with a CRLF log. The grep is guarded
# because "no match" is exit 1, which under `set -e` and `pipefail` would end
# the script in the middle of reporting a red run.

# If either MTP suite ever ends with every test passing and then an
# ArgumentOutOfRangeException about a path being "of an invalid length for use
# with domain sockets", or a TimeoutException out of
# Microsoft.CodeCoverage.Interprocess.LoggerClient.ConnectPipe, the cause is not
# here and not upstream: something in the test process has moved TMPDIR. The
# collector puts its IPC socket under TMPDIR, and its server end resolves that
# path before the test assembly is loaded — so a module initializer that
# repoints TMPDIR sends the client looking somewhere the server never bound. It
# then fails one of two ways depending only on how long the wrong path is, which
# is why it reads as two separate bugs. CB-172; the four TestBootstrap.cs files
# carry the full story and ORBWEAVER_STATUS_ROOT is the seam that replaced it.
#
# **And do not check for the report by asking whether the file is there.** Both
# of those failures still left a 5.3MB cobertura file on disk, freshly written,
# well-formed, with the same line-rate each time — the collector throws on the
# way out having already written something. So "it produced a report" was true
# throughout the whole period this was broken, and anyone who checked that way
# would have concluded the suite was fine. The find/exit-1 guards below catch a
# missing file; only `merged N` catches a present one that nobody should trust.
