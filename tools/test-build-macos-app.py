"""Runs the tail of tools/build-macos-app.sh's --install block as it ships.

That tail reports how many installed Buddies are running afterwards — none
("launch it with"), one ("Running: pid N"), or more (a warning). It used to
exit 1 instead, straight after a successful install, whenever no Buddy was
running: `running_installed` failed inside `$(...)` under `set -euo pipefail`
(pgrep exits 1 when it finds nothing), so the assignment ended the script
before the report. Found installing develop at 0e09981d; fixed under CB-245.

The text from `running_installed() {` to the `esac` that ends the report is
cut out of the script and run under the script's own shell options, with
stub `pgrep` and `ps` on PATH so the number of running copies is chosen by
the test rather than by whatever happens to be running on the machine — a
developer's Mac usually has a real Buddy up. Nothing is ever launched: `open`
is a stub too.

CB-256 renamed the executable, so three paths are in the wild (INSTALLED,
INTERIM and LEGACY below) under two process names. The stub `pgrep` therefore
answers `-x NAME` by basename, as the real one does: a stub that ignored its
argument would make a script asking for one name look the same as one asking
for both. Cases passing `with_stop` also run the step before the install
(WAS_RUNNING, the keep-alive unload and the stop-installed-buddy.sh call)
against a stub stop script, so "a phase-2 copy is stopped" is asserted on
what the script actually asked to stop.

Set BUILD_SCRIPT_UNDER_TEST to run it against another copy of the script.
