.SYNOPSIS
Wires the Claude Buddy hook into Codex on Windows, so Codex sessions show orbs.

.DESCRIPTION
The Windows twin of tools/install-codex-hooks.sh, and the sibling of
install-windows-hooks.ps1, which does this job for Claude Code.

Three things differ from the Claude Code installer, all of them measured on
macOS against a real Codex — see docs/codex-findings.md:

 1. The target is its own file. $CODEX_HOME\hooks.json is discovered
    automatically; nothing needs adding to config.toml.
 2. Codex has no Notification event. PermissionRequest is the analogue, and a
    better one: it carries the tool name. An event name Codex does not know is
    dropped *silently*, with no warning and no error, so a wrong name here would
    look exactly like a hook that never fires.
 3. PermissionRequest is installed async. A synchronous hook on that event can
    deny the user's own approval by exiting non-zero or printing anything that
    is not its expected JSON. async makes it structurally unable to return a
    decision, which is the only guarantee worth having when the failure mode is
    refusing something the user asked for.

Safe to re-run: it strips existing Claude Buddy entries before adding fresh
ones, so it converges rather than accumulating duplicates. That matters more
here than for Claude Code, because Codex's own /import copies a Claude Code
setup across and can leave hooks of its own behind.

.PARAMETER Uninstall
Remove just our entries, leaving any other tool's hooks alone.
