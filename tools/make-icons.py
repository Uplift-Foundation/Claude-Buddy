"""Draws Claude Buddy's icons so the repo doesn't need binary art checked in
by hand. Regenerate with:

    python3 tools/make-icons.py

Outputs (PNG, RGBA, straight alpha — except the .ico, noted below):
  Assets/tray-idle.png        menu-bar / notification-area icon, one per state
  Assets/tray-generating.png
  Assets/tray-waiting.png
  Assets/appicon-1024.png     source art for the .app bundle's .icns
  Assets/ClaudeBuddy.ico      multi-size Windows icon: the .exe's embedded icon
                              (csproj ApplicationIcon) and the installer's
                              SetupIconFile

Pure stdlib (zlib + struct) — no Pillow, so it runs on a stock macOS python3.
Everything is drawn by supersampling signed distance fields, which is plenty
for circles and gets us clean edges at any size.

# The *default* three colors — OrbColors.DefaultIdle / DefaultGenerating /
# DefaultWaiting in OrbColors.cs. Keep them in sync by hand.
#
# They are only defaults now: the settings window lets you pick your own, and
# TrayController re-tints the tray PNGs at runtime to match. That works because
# tray_shader below returns one constant RGB and varies only alpha, which makes
# each tray-*.png a pure alpha mask over a single color — so what actually
# matters at runtime is the *alpha* channel, i.e. the ring geometry. Change the
# geometry here and a custom-colored icon follows; change these colors and only
# the shipped defaults move.
#
# appicon-1024.png and ClaudeBuddy.ico stay on these colors whatever the user
# picks. Those are baked into the .app's .icns at build time and into the .exe's
# Win32 resources, and neither can follow a live setting.
