        // session*, and tmux chooses the most recently used one.
        //
        // Correct for a server with one session, silently wrong for a server with
        // two — and the swarm server has two, because this app's own

        // `claude-swarm` at 1787874827. The user saw an iTerm tab open, land in
        // the relay, and vanish within a beat.
        //
        // So the session is a required parameter rather than an optional one. An
        // untargeted attach is not a degraded answer here, it is an attach to
        // whatever happened to be busy — which on this server is plumbing — and a

        // '=claude-swarm'` reaches "open terminal failed: not a terminal", so the
        // target resolved and only the missing tty stopped it, while
