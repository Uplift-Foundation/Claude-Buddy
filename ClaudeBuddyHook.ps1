# It does not, on Windows: the hook command runs through a short-lived shell,
# so the immediate parent is that shell, and it exits the moment the hook
# does. Measured on a real machine — successive hook writes for one live
# session recorded 54076, then 83076, both already dead, while the session's
# actual claude.exe sat at 36804 the whole time. The app reads a dead
# session_pid as "Ctrl+C'd without a SessionEnd" and suppresses the orb, so
# every live session on Windows went invisible while a three-day-old status
# file with no session_pid at all kept its orb.
#

# (first ancestor owning a real tty) and was never wrong this way.
