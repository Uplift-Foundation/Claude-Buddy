    // Whether Claude Code's own session record says this session has been moved

    // The sibling of TranscriptHandoff, and the reason both exist is worth
    // stating together, because the second one only got written after the first
    // turned out to answer a narrower question than anyone thought.
    //
    // TranscriptHandoff reads the *transcript* for the row Claude Code appends
    // when a running turn is backgrounded. That row is real and that rule is
    // right, but it only covers a turn that was in flight. Opening agents mode
    // from an **idle** conversation forks it just the same, and writes no row at
    // all. The CLI's own decision, lifted from the 2.1.251 binary:
    //
    //     function p(e,t){ if(!e) return "idle-fork";
    //                      return t ? "defer-then-fork" : "abort-then-fork" }
    //
    // Only the two "then-fork" arms interrupt anything, and only they leave a
    // marker. `idle-fork` is silent — so a user who pressed nothing but the key
    // that opens the agents list was left looking at two orbs wearing one name,
    // with the conversation living in the fork and the husk answering to
    // nothing. Observed live: `makayla-case` as 746496c9 (pid 70580, tmux %41,
    // idle) beside e4f5c5e4 (pid 85810, `claude bg-spare`), sharing 1790 of
    // 1792 message uuids.
    //
    // What this reads instead is the fact itself. Claude Code keeps a record per
    // live session at <config-root>/sessions/<pid>.json, and parking writes
    // `parkedJobId` onto it naming the job that took the conversation. Its own
    // wording for the state, also lifted from the binary, is "session <id>,
    // moved to the background from this window". Coming back out of the agents
    // view clears the field again, so it is scoped to exactly the question an
    // orb is asking — is this window showing the conversation right now — and
    // needs no marker sniffing to answer it.
    //
    // Pure half and I/O half, separated the way TranscriptHandoff's and
    // TranscriptIdentity's are: the thing with a right answer takes text, so it
    // can be asserted against a record captured off a real machine rather than
