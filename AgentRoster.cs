    // knows by a given name.
    //
    // This exists to answer one question exactly, where getting it nearly right
    // would be worse than not answering. A peer row on the far side carries a
    // *name* — `job-hunter` — and nothing else identifying: no pid, no session
    // id, no machine (`ListAgents` was asked directly and said
    // `"machine":"unknown"`; see docs/remote-control-findings.md). Buddy's own
    // status files are keyed by session id and carry a Title that is whatever
    // /rename last set, which is frequently not that name — the names Claude
    // Code registers look derived from the working directory (`placement-41`,
    // `evidence`) unless someone changed them. So matching a peer name against
    // Title, or against the folder, is guesswork, and a wrong match here means
    // showing one session's private conversation on another session's panel.
    //
    // `claude agents --json` removes the guess. It is the same registry the peer
    // list is drawn from, it runs locally against the same profile, and it
    // prints the session id alongside the name — so name → session id → status
    // file is an exact join rather than a resemblance. Shape, captured from a
    // real run rather than remembered:
    //
