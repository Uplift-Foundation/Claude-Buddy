        //     **twelve seconds later**, and 15 at 12:19:24 against 18 at
        //     12:20:29 — sixty-five seconds. A second account moved 48 to 49
        //     across that same gap, so it is not one account behaving oddly.
        //   - The figure moves in **one-point steps**, because the API reports
        //     an integer utilization. The twelve-second 24-to-23 is that integer
        //     flipping either side of 23.5, which is itself proof the value
        //     behind it is being re-read on that timescale rather than frozen.
        //   - The steps are bursty, not periodic. Idle, the account sat at
        //     exactly 19 for ten straight minutes. Busy, it went 19 to 23 inside
        //     fifty-six seconds. So the staleness this interval buys is a few
        //     points most of the time and worse during a burst.
        //
        // And what it costs, on the machine that prompted the question — load
        // average 5.5 across 14 cores, twenty-plus `claude` processes alive:
        // one full CompositeUsageSource.Read() is three subprocesses (a
        // `claude -p` per Claude account plus one `codex app-server`; Grok is
        // read off disk) and ran 4.5s to 7.7s of wall clock across thirteen

        // to keep the floor — not a cache that would make a faster poll
        // pointless, because it would not.
        //

        // median: RunOne gives up at 20s and CodexAppServerUsage.Ask at 15s, and

        // reading it already had. A cadence fast enough to start missing its own

        // zero dropped readings in thirteen rounds), but that was one machine on
        // one afternoon.
