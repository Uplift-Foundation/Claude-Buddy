    // peer's ask every ten seconds, and the pictures in it were animated GIFs of
    // 11-15 MB: reading and hashing each of them on every build was most of the
    // work in answering. So a picture is kept against the file's length and
    // modification time, and read again only when either changes, which is also
    // what makes a changed picture reach the peer promptly: the next roster names
    // a new id.
    //
    // The second job is answering AVATAR, which names a picture by id: only an id
    // this machine has offered is answered, from the bytes it offered under it.
    //
    // Bounded, because pictures are large and sessions come and go all day. The
    // oldest entry goes first; forgetting one costs a single re-read the next
    // time it is offered, never a wrong answer.
