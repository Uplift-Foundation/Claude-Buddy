    // this. The orb resolved the session's persona voice and then spoke the raw
    // reply, ignoring the scope setting entirely. The panel honoured the scope
    // and then spoke it in the wrong voice, because its own resolver had no arm
    // for a local session. Every user pressing either button got exactly the
    // half the other one was missing.
    //
    // Two parallel fixes would have left that structure in place, which is what
    // produced the bug: nothing about two independent implementations of one
    // feature says which of them is authoritative, so they drift and nobody
    // notices until a user describes both halves in one sentence. So both
    // buttons now enter here and the drift has nowhere to happen.
    //
    // What it is *not* is a speech engine. The decisions — which text, whose
    // voice, what the button shows while waiting, what happens when the
    // summariser fails — all live here, in ordinary methods a headless test can
    // call. Only the utterance itself is excluded, and it is one line.
