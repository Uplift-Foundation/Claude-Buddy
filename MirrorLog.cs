    // (CB-54), a queue the waiting itself built (CB-55), a poll starving the
    // fetch (CB-56), an idle timer retiring the relay under an open panel
    // (CB-57), a relay that stopped with nothing to restart it (CB-60), and a
    // far machine receiving well-formed frames and answering none of them.
    //
    // Every one of those was diagnosed by reading relay transcripts and
    // inferring, because nothing on the serving side ever recorded a decision.
    // That is a slow way to find a fault and a very easy way to be confident and
    // wrong: this session alone killed five plausible theories that way, each of
    // which would have shipped as a fix.
    //
    // Deliberately cheap and deliberately dull. One line per decision, no
    // levels, no categories, no formatting — a frame arrived, this is what
    // happened to it. The value is entirely in there being a record at all.
