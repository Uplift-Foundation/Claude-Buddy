    //    post-turn summary.

    //    message we sent.

    //    ("requesting"), or a session_update's `connection_status`.

    //    `content_block_delta` with a `text_delta`. Only text: a thinking or
    //    tool-input delta is not text the panel shows.
    //  * InnerType — a `stream_event`'s inner `event.type`: message_start,
    //    content_block_start, content_block_delta, content_block_stop,
    //    message_delta, message_stop.

    //    turn reconciles with the bubble added after the send's 2xx. On a
    //    delivery_update it is that event's `event_id`, presumed (not
    //    confirmed) to be the uuid we sent.

    // assembled — so every framing rule is a unit test over a list of lines.
    //
    // The rules, and the argument for each where there is one:
    //
    //  * `field: value`, with **one** optional space after the colon removed.
    //    A line with no colon is a field name with an empty value.
    //  * `data` lines accumulate, joined by `\n`, so a multi-line payload
    //    survives intact.
    //  * A blank line dispatches — but only if some `data` arrived. An event
    //    with no data is not dispatched, per the spec, and nothing measured
    //    sends one.
    //  * A line starting `:` is a comment. **Measured as the keepalive**, every
    //    12–15 s, so it is surfaced as its own frame rather than swallowed: a
    //    consumer can tell a quiet stream from a dead one by it.
    //  * `retry` and unknown fields are ignored. The server's retry hint is not
    //    obeyed: reconnect timing is ClaudeCloudStreamPolicy's decision, and a
    //    server-chosen interval is the kind of number that becomes a retry storm.
    //  * A trailing `\r` is stripped. A reader that splits on `\n` alone would
    //    otherwise hand CRLF lines over with it attached, and `data: {..}\r` is
    //    not JSON.
    //
    // **The departure: the id does not persist from one event to the next.** The
    // spec keeps a "last event id" that later events inherit. Here only
    // `client_event`s carry an id — it is the durable sequence number — and an
    // ephemeral event after one must not appear to carry that event's sequence
