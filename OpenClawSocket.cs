    // ClientWebSocket: the gateway hardcodes `minVersion: "TLSv1.3"`, and .NET
    // on macOS cannot speak TLS 1.3 at all — it fails the same way against
    // cloudflare.com, because SecureTransport tops out at 1.2. That is a
    // property of the platform, not of this gateway, and macOS is this app's
    // primary one. An ssh tunnel doesn't sidestep it either: the gateway
    // refuses plain HTTP on loopback, so a forwarded port arrives at the same
    // handshake. See docs/openclaw-findings.md.
    //
    // So the TLS is done by BouncyCastle, which is already a dependency for the
    // gateway's Ed25519 device identity and carries a managed TLS 1.3 client.
    // The WebSocket upgrade is then a plain HTTP/1.1 exchange over that stream,
    // and the framing goes back to the BCL via WebSocket.CreateFromStream —
    // only the transport is hand-rolled, not the protocol.
