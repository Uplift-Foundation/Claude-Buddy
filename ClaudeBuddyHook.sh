# Claude Buddy hook for macOS/Linux — bash twin of ClaudeBuddyHook.ps1.
# Usage (from a Claude Code or Codex hook):
#   ClaudeBuddyHook.sh <idle|generating|waiting|ended>
#   ClaudeBuddyHook.sh codex <idle|generating|waiting|ended>
# Reads the hook payload JSON on stdin for session_id and cwd.
#
# One script for both CLIs rather than two, because almost none of it is about
# either: finding the terminal, finding the session's process, and writing the
# status file are the same job whoever asked. The agent word only gates the
# handful of places where the two genuinely differ, and each of those says why.
#
# It must exit 0 and print nothing, whatever happens. That has always been good
# manners; under Codex it is load-bearing. Codex reads a hook's stdout as JSON
# with `additionalProperties: false`, so anything printed is
# "hook returned invalid permission-request JSON output" — and **exit status 2
# is a deny**. A hook that fails noisily would start refusing the user's own
# approvals. See docs/codex-findings.md.

# Claude Code. Codex's PreToolUse and PermissionRequest payloads embed
# `tool_input` as arbitrary JSON, and its own command records carry
# `"cwd":"file:///…"` — so a nested key would win and CWD would become
# something that is not a directory. Everything downstream keys off cwd: the
# orb's name, its saved position, which sessions are siblings.
#
# grep -o takes the first, which is the top-level one, because the payload
# writes its own fields before nesting anything.

# `modified`, so its hooks stop running until the review is accepted again.
# Turning a colour on would silently stop every Codex orb until the user

# What Codex calls this chat. It has both halves of what Claude Code has, in

#
#   name   <- /rename, the name you chose
#   title  <- Codex's own, taken from the first thing you asked
#
# Same precedence as the Claude Code branch above, and for the same reason: a
# name you set by hand outranks a generated one however recently the generated
# one was written. There is still no /color equivalent, so COLOR stays empty and
# a Codex orb keeps the plain ring.
#
# Read from the database on every hook rather than cached in the status file,
# which is what the first version of this did. Caching was there to avoid
# grepping a multi-megabyte rollout, and a primary-key lookup costs nothing —
# measured at 7ms against the live file. It also means /rename shows up on the
# orb at the next hook instead of never, which is a limitation Claude Code
# sessions still have.
#
# Read-only, via a file: URI, so a hook can never take a write lock on a
# database Codex is using. Anything that goes wrong here — no sqlite3, a
# database mid-write, a schema this doesn't recognise — falls through to the
# rollout, which is the same answer by a slower route.

# The ancestor that owns the tty is the claude TUI process itself, so the same
# walk that finds the tty also hands us the pid to record. The app uses it to
# tell "this session is still running" from "this file was left behind": a
# session killed with Ctrl+C never fires SessionEnd, so its file survives, and
# without a pid the only way to notice is to wait out the orb lifetime — which
# is forever if that is what you picked. See SessionManager.SessionGone.
#
# For Codex the walk looks for the codex process by name first, and only then
# for a tty. The two usually land on the same process and the distinction only
# shows up in one case — but it is a case that costs someone an orb they were
# using. Claude Code running `codex exec` as a Bash tool puts a codex process
# in a pipe with no tty of its own, so a tty-only walk would run straight past
# it and record *Claude's* pid. The app groups status files by pid to work out
# which one supersedes which, so the nested codex file would be the newest in
# Claude's bucket and would delete the live Claude orb.
# Claude Code gets the same by-name treatment Codex already had, and for a
# failure that turned out to be worse.
#
# A tty-only walk records the first ancestor that owns a terminal, which for a
# session with no terminal of its own is *somebody else's* process. Measured on
# a real machine: a session dispatched from `claude agents` walked past its own
# pid (no tty, being a background agent) and recorded the **viewer's** pid
# instead. The consequence is not a cosmetic mislabel — SessionManager reads a
# recorded pid as "is this session still alive", so when that session later
# ended, its orb stayed on screen forever pointing at a dead conversation,
# because the pid it named belonged to a viewer that was still running. Two orbs
# for one conversation, one of them a ghost with a stale transcript behind it.
#
# So the pid is now found by identifying this session's own process rather than
# by whoever happens to own a terminal. The claude binary reports its comm as
# either "claude" or a bare version ("2.1.240") depending on how it was
# launched — both observed on the same machine, which is why both are matched.
# Helpers that are also the claude binary are skipped by name: the background
# pty host, a spare, the daemon, and the agents viewer are none of them the
# session that fired this hook.
#
# TTY is deliberately left to the old rule. What terminal to focus and what pid
# is alive are two different questions, and conflating them is what caused this;
# a background agent legitimately has no terminal of its own, and
# AgentTeamViewer already knows how to find the window you watch it in.
