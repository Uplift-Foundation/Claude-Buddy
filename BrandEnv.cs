    // job somebody wrote by hand or a launchd plist can carry the old name for
    // years, and a test seam that silently stops redirecting does not fail —
    // it writes into the real settings.json, the real log directory, the real
    // bundle cache. So the new name wins and the old one is the fallback,
    // here and in the copies the shell installers carry (their brand_env
    // function), and nowhere else.
    //
    // One helper rather than nine copies of a two-name read, so the fallback
    // can be deleted by one grep for LegacyPrefix: nothing outside this file
    // spells the old prefix in C#, and LogDirSingleReadSiteTests holds every
    // read of either spelling to this file.
    //
    // An empty value counts as unset on both spellings, matching every read
    // this replaced (`is { Length: > 0 }`) and CrashLogFormatTests' case that
    // sets "" to mean "not redirected". Without that an exported-but-empty
    // ORBWEAVER_SETTINGS_DIR would shadow a real legacy value with nothing.
