    // Talking to the account API's cloud-sessions endpoint.
    //
    // **Everything in this file is about an undocumented API.** It is
    // `GET https://api.anthropic.com/v2/ccr-sessions`, measured by hand during
    // CB-164 rather than read from documentation, and the product decision on
    // that ticket accepted the maintenance cost of depending on it with eyes
    // open. The consequence for the code is that every shape here is treated as
    // something that can move without notice: a request that comes back wrong
    // produces a legible outcome and no cloud orbs, never a crash and never a
    // retry storm.
    //
    // **The host is api.anthropic.com and that is the whole first lesson of this
    // ticket.** The first attempt aimed at claude.ai, because claude.ai/code is
    // where a person reads this roster — and claude.ai answers a non-browser
    // client with a Cloudflare challenge, *identically* for a real token and a
    // bogus one. That identical pair is what makes it expensive: it looks exactly
    // like a credential being refused, so an afternoon went into the credential
    // and none into the host. The header set that grew out of it — six headers
    // the endpoint supposedly 400s without — was the browser's, not the API's.
    // Against api.anthropic.com **two** headers are required and the other four
    // are ignored. See docs/claude-cloud-findings.md for the measurement table.
    //
    // The transport is a plain HttpClient, as NeuralSpeech uses. Emphatically
    // *not* OpenClawSocket's BouncyCastle TLS stack — that exists because a
    // self-signed LAN gateway speaks TLS 1.3 that .NET on macOS cannot, and
    // api.anthropic.com is an ordinary public HTTPS host with a real certificate.
    // Copying it would mean hand-rolling TLS against a host that does not need it.
