    // Where the `codex` CLI is, for the parts of this app that shell out to it.
    //
    // Same problem and same answer as ClaudeBinary, whose comment has the full
    // story: launched from Finder or as a login item this app gets the bare
    // system PATH, and handing the command to the user's shell does not fix it
    // because `zsh -lc` never reads .zshrc. So the known install locations are
    // checked directly and PATH is consulted last.
    //
    // Two differences from ClaudeBinary, both because Codex installs
    // differently. The standalone package is the usual install here and puts a
    // symlink in ~/.local/bin pointing into ~/.codex/packages — both are listed,
    // since the symlink is what a user creates and the target is what survives
    // a broken one. And the PATH search tries executable extensions, because on
    // Windows an npm-installed CLI is `codex.cmd` and a bare "codex" exists
    // nowhere on disk; ClaudeBinary does not do this, which is worth its own
    // ticket rather than a silent change here.
