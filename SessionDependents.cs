    // What is running *underneath* a session's pid, asked before anything is

    //
    // SessionTerminator's header says why signalling the session's own pid is
    // safe: "Not TermPid, which is the terminal the user is typing in; not the
    // daemon, which hosts every other background job on the machine. One worker
    // hosts exactly one session." Both exclusions are true of every ordinary
    // session and both are false of one shape — the husk a backgrounded turn
    // leaves behind, where the interactive session that forked the turn is
    // simultaneously the window the user is reading and the ancestor of the
    // daemon that now owns the work.
    //
    // Measured on a real Mac (macOS 27.0, Claude Buddy 0.4.2-beta), read off
    // `ps`, with the husk at the bottom rather than the top:
    //
    //   claude --session-id … --fork-session --resume …   <- the live job
    //    └─ claude --bg-pty-host
    //        └─ claude daemon run
    //            └─ claude                                <- the husk, in a tmux pane
    //
    // Ending the husk on that machine killed the husk alone: the daemon was
    // reparented to launchd and the job survived with its transcript intact. So
    // nothing was lost, and the gesture still destroyed the only window onto
    // live work, silently, from an orb presenting itself as stale. The Windows
    // arm is the serious half — `Kill(entireProcessTree: true)` against a pid
    // whose descendants are the daemon and every job under it, with
    // TerminateProcess semantics: no SessionEnd, no transcript flush. That arm
    // is **inferred from the code and this process tree and has not been

    // message so the next person reading this file knows which half was
    // measured.
