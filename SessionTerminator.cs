    // "Stop this session", asked once, by hand, from an orb's context menu.
    //
    // Structured like ProcessLiveness next door — one question, one libc call on
    // Unix, a Windows arm that does the same thing a different way — and for the
    // same reason: the decision about *whether* to ask belongs somewhere pure
    // and testable (SessionPresence.CanEndSession), so all that is left here is
    // the syscall.
    //
    // SIGTERM, not SIGKILL. The pid is a `claude` process, which handles TERM by
    // finishing its own shutdown — flushing the transcript, running SessionEnd,
    // which deletes the status file and takes the orb with it. SIGKILL would
    // leave both behind and land the cleanup on the sweep instead.
    //
    // That reasoning is the Unix arm's alone, and the Windows arm cannot have
    // it: Kill() is TerminateProcess, which is unconditional and runs no
    // shutdown, so there is no SessionEnd and no `rm -f`. On Windows the orb
    // still goes on the next scan — the pid stops answering, which is all
    // ProcessGone needs — and the file waits for the sweep's grace to expire.
    // Nothing is lost either way; the difference is ten minutes of a file
    // nobody is looking at, and .NET offers no portable "ask it to stop".
    //
    // Only ever the session's own pid. Not TermPid, which is the terminal the
    // user is typing in; not the daemon, which hosts every other background job
    // on the machine. One worker hosts exactly one session — each row of
    // `claude agents --json` names a distinct pid — so this ends exactly what
    // the menu item said it would.
    //
    // **That last paragraph is false for exactly one shape, and this is what
    // CB-26 added.** For the husk a backgrounded turn leaves behind, the
    // session's own pid is simultaneously the terminal the user is typing in
    // *and* the ancestor of the daemon: both exclusions are violated by the
    // same pid, so neither of them is doing the work the comment credits it
    // with. The Unix arm signalled one pid and killed the user's only window
    // onto a running job; the Windows arm would have taken the whole tree,
    // daemon included, with no SessionEnd and no transcript flush.
    //
    // So a pid is now asked what is underneath it before it is signalled at
    // all, and the answer travels with it rather than being looked up here —
    // SessionDependents.Of reads the process table, SessionDependents.Inspect
    // decides, and the same verdict that disabled the menu row is the one
    // handed to this call. A required parameter rather than a lookup inside,
    // because a caller cannot forget an argument the compiler demands, and
    // because looking it up here would ask the machine twice for one gesture
    // and could get two different answers.
