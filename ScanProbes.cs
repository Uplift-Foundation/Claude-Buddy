    // `lsof` per viewer lookup, `claude agents --json` whenever its cache ran
    // out. Profiled on a machine with about fifteen tmux-hosted sessions and 890
    // processes, the UI thread was about 66% busy and inside one of those calls
    // in six snapshots out of six — so every menu, drag and chat panel waited on

    // one cached call on a background thread. Failing to ask one that is read
    // changes an orb.

    // not pay for — a machine with nothing but ordinary terminal sessions asks
    // the daemon nothing and walks no process table, exactly as before. The
