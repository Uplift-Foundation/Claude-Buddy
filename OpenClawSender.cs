    // Who said a user-role message the gateway handed us, and what of it is
    // worth showing.
    //
    // Pure and separate for the same reason ChatSpeaker and OpenClawSessionKind
    // are: the rule is small, it decides something a person will read as an
    // assertion about who was talking, and checking it any other way means
    // opening a panel and looking at bubbles.
    //
    // The problem it solves is that every message in a Discord channel arrives
    // in *every* member agent's transcript in the user role, whoever sent it,
    // and until now nothing here distinguished them. The room's answer was to
    // draw all of them as the room's own neutral voice — honest, and the
    // comment in OpenClawRoomChatSession.Rebuild explains why that beat the
    // alternative, but it means your own message comes back to you looking like
    // someone else's.
    //
    // It turns out the gateway does say, in an undocumented `__openclaw` block
    // on each message. Four shapes were measured on a live gateway (OpenClaw
    // 2026.7.1-2, protocol 4) across five agents' transcripts, durable across
    // history reloads back over a fortnight:
    //
    //   * The operator typing in Discord — senderIsOwner true, plus their
    //     Discord id, display name and username.
    //   * The operator typing here, in Claude Buddy — no sender fields at all,
    //     and a top-level idempotencyKey of "<guid>:user". That suffix is what
    //     separates it from the agent's own reply, which carries
    //     "cli-assistant:<guid>" and is assistant-role anyway.
    //   * Another agent's message relayed through the channel — senderIsOwner
    //     false, plus the bot's Discord *display name*. Richer than expected:
    //     a relayed agent turn is named, not anonymous.
    //   * An inter-session message from sessions_send — no sender fields, and a
    //     "[Inter-session message]" header that Readable() already parses. It
    //     reaches Classify with that header gone, so it falls through to
    //     Unknown here and keeps the speaker Readable found.
    //
    // **A third person in the channel is assumed, not observed.** No human but
    // the operator appears anywhere in the retained history, so what someone
    // else's message looks like is an inference from the relay shape —
    // senderIsOwner false plus their name. The rendering chosen is the same
    // either way (a named turn, drawn as someone else's), which is why the gap
    // is tolerable rather than blocking; it is written down here because an
    // assumption nobody records is indistinguishable from a measurement.
    //
    // The whole rule degrades to what this app did before it when the metadata
    // is absent: no fields, no idempotency key and no prefix means Unknown,
    // which is the anonymous turn the room has always drawn. That is the safety
    // net if the gateway's internals move — this reads a shape nobody here
    // controls and nobody else documents.
